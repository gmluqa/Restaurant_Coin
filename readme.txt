PROBLEM:
	NEED TO MOTIVATE USERS TO GIVE THEIR OPINION ON RESTAURANTS
	
VALUE:
	OUR DATA IS CLEAN, TRACEABLE, OPEN, STANDARD, REAL
	
SOLUTION: 
	IF USER.REVIEWS()
	USER.REVIEW_PUBLISH()
	USER.RECIEVES_RESTAURANT_COIN()
	
RESTAURANT_COIN CAN:
	- Purchase items and services at affiliated restaurants
	- Redeem discounts, exclusive offers at affiliated restaurants
	- Give reputation to high quality reviewers
	
The way restaurant coin gives away items, is first through subsidy of these items by the restaurant coin team.
Once the network is established, reviewers will be hooked to the model and work autonomously.
The restaurants will see how much traffic is generated, and start by giving away items at raffles, to rewarding users with their sub-domain restuarant coin.

Restaurant coin is a project built on NEAR, it uses CONTEXT for network data (reviewer, restaurant) and LEMONADE for restaurant on-boarding.

The stack:
	- NEAR for simplicity, end user focus, speed and scalability.
	- CONTEXT to create a data standard, a smartdoc.
	- LEMONADE for ease of on-boarding, and affiliate channel sale.
